# Business Problem

Managing personal and business finances effectively requires clear visibility into income, expenses, savings, and financial targets. Many individuals struggle with tracking their financial health, leading to ineffective budgeting and missed financial goals.

This project solves the problem by providing an interactive Finance Dashboard that enables users to:

1. Track income, expenses, savings, and financial targets over time.

2. Identify spending patterns and optimize budgeting strategies.

3. Compare income vs. savings and track monthly financial growth.

4. Analyze financial distributions across various components like rent, groceries, investments, and leisure.

# Solution Approach

To address these challenges, I developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard that integrates financial data and provides actionable insights. The dashboard includes:
